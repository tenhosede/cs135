C++ Arithmetic, Library Functions, and Assignment

For each of the following questions, replace the ________ with
your response.

Evaluate each of the following expressions. If the final result is
floating-point, include a decimal.

1. 25 % 9 - 9 / 2 => 3


2. 6 + 11 % 15 - pow(3,2) => 8


3. 4 / 3 * 6 + 4.5 => 12.5


4. 4 * (2.0 / 5) + 2 => 3.6


5. 101 / 5 % 7 - 3 * 2.0 => 0


Suppose a program contains the following declarations and assignment
statements. Assume cmath has been included in the program.

int x, y, z;
double a, b;
x = 17;
y = 4;
a = 5.8;

Answer each of the following questions. Include a decimal if the value
stored is floating-point.

6. What is stored in z after the statement is executed?

   z = 3 + x % 6;    z is 8


7. What is stored in b after the statement is executed?

   b = int(sqrt(x+9)) + y * 2;   b is 13



8. What is stored in b after the statement is executed?

   b = y / 3 + 9.1;    b is 10.1



9. What is stored in z after the statement is executed?

   z = a - x % y + (x - 11) * 0.5;

   z is 7


10. What is stored in z after the statment is executed?

    z = double (y / x + 1) - a;

    z is -4
    

After typing in your responses to each of the questions, use the
mail utility to email this file to your lab instructor.
